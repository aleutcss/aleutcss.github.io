# Images

The aleutcss `images` module provides very basic styling for images (`img`).
This makes all the images responsive (scaling to 100%) unless width or height
are defined on the `img`-tag (or if it is a google-map).


## Install using npm:

```shell
    $ npm install --save-dev aleut-images
```
