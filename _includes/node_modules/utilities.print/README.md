# Print

The aleutcss `print` module is a very crude, very basic reset-like module for
print styles. It borrows basic rules from [HTML5
Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).

It does a few things for the look for printers
* Makes all backgrounds transparent
* Displays the web-adress on links
* Displays the description on `abbr`


## Install using npm:

```ssh
	$ npm install --save-dev aleut.utilities.print

```
